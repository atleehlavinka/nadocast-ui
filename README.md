# nadocast-ui

an unofficial user interface for the nadocast project

## What is Nadocast?

[Nadocast](https://github.com/brianhempel/nadocast) is a fantastic project (by Brian Hempel) with the goal of
forecasting tornado probabilities.
Current predictions are [posted to twitter](https://twitter.com/nadocast) at regular intervals. There is also
a [viewer](http://data.nadocast.com/viewer.html).

## What is "nadocast-ui" ?

Nadocast-ui is an unofficial supplemental interface for viewing forecasts published/created by nadocast. Features
include an interactive choropleth map and ability to "scrub" through predictions.
It is written mostly in python, using the [Dash Plotly framework](https://dash.plotly.com/) for maps and charting.

Anyone can run nadocast-ui locally or on their own server!  I currently have a hosted version running
at: [https://nadocast-ui.robswc.me/](https://nadocast-ui.robswc.me/)
